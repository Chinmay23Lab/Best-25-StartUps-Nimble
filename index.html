    <!-- Chosen Palette: "Warm Neutrals" - A calm and professional palette using shades of beige, slate, and a subtle navy accent for focus. -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-column, scrollable dashboard. Key features include a main header, a filter/sort control bar, and a dynamic list of startup 'cards'. Clicking a card expands an inline detail section directly below it for focused exploration, eliminating the need for a separate detail panel and reducing vertical scrolling for details. Below this, a visualization section with two charts (Donut for country distribution, Bar for theme distribution) provides a high-level summary of the report's key trends. This interactive, non-linear design was chosen over a static page to enhance user engagement, discoverability of trends, and overall usability, with inline details improving context and reducing navigation effort. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Startup List/Inline Detail View: (Report Info: Full startup profiles) -> (Goal: Inform, Organize, Explore) -> (Viz: Interactive HTML cards with collapsible inline details) -> (Interaction: Click to toggle details, filter/sort list) -> (Justification: Manages information density, keeps context with the list item, allows user-driven exploration without page jumps) -> (Method: Vanilla JS DOM manipulation, Tailwind for collapse). 2. Country Distribution: (Report Info: Startup countries) -> (Goal: Compare) -> (Viz: Donut Chart) -> (Interaction: Hover tooltips) -> (Justification: Clearly shows parts-of-a-whole for geographic spread) -> (Library: Chart.js). 3. Innovation Themes: (Report Info: Categorized core innovations) -> (Goal: Analyze, Compare) -> (Viz: Horizontal Bar Chart) -> (Interaction: Hover tooltips) -> (Justification: Best for comparing counts across distinct categories, highlighting key innovation trends) -> (Library: Chart.js). -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                            <p class="text-slate-600">Axiom Space achieved a major milestone with the successful launch and splashdown of Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4) between June and July 2025. This 18-day mission included over 60 research activities and 23 outreach events from 31 countries, making it the most research-intensive Axiom Space mission to date. This highlights the growing demand for LEO access for scientific, technological, and educational purposes. Axiom Space's focus on microgravity research (e.g., supporting astronauts with diabetes, developing edge computing for crew readiness, studying cancer in LEO) and educational outreach (e.g., ISS HAM Radio, Limitless Space Institute Student Experiments) indicates a broad and impactful growth trajectory. Their work on the commercial space station positions them as a foundational player in the future space economy.</p>

                            <p class="text-slate-600">Stoke Space has demonstrated significant recent traction through a series of successful technical milestones. These include a vertical hotfire of their Zenith engine (full-flow staged combustion) in December 2024, a reentry heat shield demonstration at flight heating conditions in February 2024, and a flight demonstration of a full-scale reusable upper stage prototype in September 2023. In April 2025, they achieved an Andromeda engine hotfire over 100% Power Level. A major validation of their potential came on March 27, 2025, when Stoke Space was selected to participate in the U.S. Space Force’s National Security Space Launch (NSSL) Phase 3 Lane 1 program, aimed at expanding capacity for national security payloads. Their rapid reactivation of Space Launch Complex 14 at Cape Canaveral in less than a year further underscores their operational efficiency. The company aims to slash atmospheric impact by 98% compared to current rockets, aligning with growing sustainability demands and fostering a booming space economy. Their vertically integrated operations, allowing for rapid design, manufacturing, and testing, position them for swift growth in the space industry.</p>

                            <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">ThatDot's core innovation is the Quine Streaming Graph, a real-time streaming graph engine that provides immediate visibility into valuable patterns across massive data streams. This technology enables the ingestion and analysis of internet-scale data without dropping data or compromising depth. It is designed to uncover deep threats by identifying complex attack patterns spanning billions of events over months and to respond in milliseconds, triggering actions the moment a full threat pattern emerges.</p>
                            <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-slate-800">Growth Trajectory & Market Impact</h4>
                            <p class="text-slate-600">ThatDot has demonstrated significant traction through collaborations with notable organizations including DARPA, In-Q-Tel, CrowdStrike, the US Air Force, and the US Navy. The Quine Streaming Graph was developed with DARPA and funded by CrowdStrike, underscoring its strategic importance in defense and cybersecurity sectors. The technology can process data at sustained rates beyond 1 million events per second per cluster, handling unlimited graph sizes and ensuring no data loss even with hardware failures. Its ability to identify complex, multi-hop patterns (10, 20, 100+ hops) and provide millisecond-latency insights makes it a critical tool for cybersecurity, banking, and defense, indicating substantial growth potential in high-stakes data environments.</p>
